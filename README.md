A privacy-focused, client-side PDF toolkit. Merge, reorder, rotate, and extract pages from PDF files and images with 100% client-side processing. All file processing happens entirely in your browser - your files are never uploaded to our servers.

**App:** [pdf.helvety.com](https://pdf.helvety.com)

**Privacy First** - 100% Client-Side Processing. All file processing happens entirely in your browser. Your file data is never uploaded to our servers. We use Vercel Analytics for anonymous page view statistics only (see [Privacy Policy](https://helvety.com/privacy)).

Helvety PDF is a 100% free tool with no limits and no login required. All features are available to everyone - unlimited files, unlimited pages.

## Service Availability

Helvety services are intended exclusively for customers located in Switzerland. **We are not able to serve customers in the EU/EEA.**

As a Swiss company, Helvety operates solely under the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (nDSG). Because we do not target or serve customers in the EU/EEA, the GDPR does not apply. For this reason, new users are asked to confirm during account creation on [auth.helvety.com](https://auth.helvety.com) that they are located in Switzerland before any personal data is stored. Note: Helvety PDF itself requires no login or account - this applies to other Helvety apps that require authentication.

## Features

- **Client-side file processing** - All operations happen in your browser
- **PDF and image support** - Upload PDF files and images (PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, etc.)
- **Page thumbnails preview** - Visual preview of all pages before processing
- **Drag & drop reordering** - Easily rearrange pages by dragging thumbnails
- **Page rotation** - Rotate individual pages by 90° increments
- **Page deletion** - Remove unwanted pages from your documents
- **Page extraction** - Extract individual pages as separate PDF files
- **Multi-file merging** - Combine multiple PDF files and images into one PDF
- **Drag & drop upload** - Intuitive file upload interface
- **Customizable grid layout** - Adjust pages per row to accommodate different page sizes
- **Dark & Light mode support** - Comfortable viewing in any lighting condition
- **App Switcher** - Navigate between Helvety ecosystem apps (Home, Auth, Store, PDF, Tasks, Contacts)
- **Unlimited files and pages** - No restrictions, completely free
- **No login required** - Use the tool instantly, no account needed

## How It Works

1. **Upload Files** - Drag and drop or click to browse and select multiple PDF files and/or images
2. **Preview & Manage** - See thumbnails of all pages, reorder by dragging, rotate, or delete pages as needed
3. **Download** - Your processed PDF downloads automatically with a timestamped filename

## Security

**Note:** End-to-end encryption is not used in this app. E2EE is used by [Helvety Tasks](https://tasks.helvety.com) and [Helvety Contacts](https://contacts.helvety.com).

### Security Hardening

This application implements comprehensive security hardening:

- **Security Headers** - CSP, HSTS, and other security headers

**Legal Pages:** Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Impressum are hosted centrally on [helvety.com](https://helvety.com) and linked in the site footer. Services are exclusively available to customers in Switzerland and are not offered to EU/EEA residents; new users must confirm they are located in Switzerland during account creation on [auth.helvety.com](https://auth.helvety.com) (before any personal data is stored). Only the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (nDSG) applies; the GDPR does not apply. An informational cookie notice informs visitors that only essential cookies are used.

**Abuse Reporting:** Abuse reports can be submitted to [abuse@helvety.com](mailto:abuse@helvety.com). The Impressum on [helvety.com/impressum](https://helvety.com/impressum#abuse) includes a dedicated abuse reporting section with guidance for both users and law enforcement.
