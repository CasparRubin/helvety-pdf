## How It Works

1. **Upload Files** - Drag and drop or click to browse and select multiple PDF files and/or images
2. **Preview & Manage** - See thumbnails of all pages, reorder by dragging, rotate, or delete pages as needed
3. **Download** - Your processed PDF downloads automatically with a timestamped filename

## Security & Authentication

### Authentication Flow

Authentication is handled by the centralized Helvety Auth service (`auth.helvety.com`) using **email + passkey authentication** — no passwords required. **Login is optional** — users can use the PDF tool without an account. Login is only required for Pro subscription features.

**New Users (when signing in):**

1. Click "Sign in" → Redirected to auth.helvety.com → Enter email address
2. Enter verification code from email → Verify email ownership
3. Scan QR code with phone → Verify with biometrics (Face ID/fingerprint)
4. Passkey created → Verify passkey → Session established → Redirected back to PDF app

**Returning Users (when signing in):**

1. Click "Sign in" → Redirected to auth.helvety.com → Enter email address
2. Sign in with passkey (no email sent; existing users with a passkey skip email verification)
3. Scan QR code → Verify with biometrics → Session created
4. Redirected back to PDF app

Sessions are shared across all `*.helvety.com` subdomains via cookie-based SSO.

**Privacy Note:** Your email address is used solely for authentication (verification codes for new users, passkey for returning) and account recovery. We do not share your email with third parties for marketing purposes.

**Note:** End-to-end encryption is not used in this app. E2EE is only used by [Helvety Tasks](https://tasks.helvety.com).

### Security Hardening

This application implements comprehensive security hardening:

- **Session Management** - Session validation and refresh via `proxy.ts` using `getClaims()` (local JWT validation; Auth API only when refresh is needed)
- **Server Layout Guards** - Authentication checks in Server Components via `lib/auth-guard.ts` (CVE-2025-29927 compliant)
- **Redirect URI Validation** - All redirect URIs validated against allowlist via `lib/redirect-validation.ts` to prevent open redirect attacks
- **CSRF Protection** - Token-based protection for state-changing operations
- **Rate Limiting** - Protection against brute force attacks
- **Idle Timeout** - Automatic session expiration after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Audit Logging** - Structured logging for authentication and encryption events
- **Security Headers** - CSP, HSTS, and other security headers

**Legal Pages:** Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Impressum are hosted centrally on [helvety.com](https://helvety.com) and linked in the site footer. An informational cookie notice informs visitors that only essential cookies are used (Swiss nDSG / EU ePrivacy compliant).
