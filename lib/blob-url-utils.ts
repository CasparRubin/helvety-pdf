 * Safely revokes a blob URL if it exists and is valid.

 * 
 * @param url - The blob URL to revoke, or null/undefined
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * safeRevokeObjectURL(blobUrl) // Safe even if already revoked
 * safeRevokeObjectURL(null)    // No-op
 * ```

// NOTE: createBlobURLWithCleanup was removed as it was unused.
// The downloadBlob function in file-download.ts handles URL lifecycle internally.
